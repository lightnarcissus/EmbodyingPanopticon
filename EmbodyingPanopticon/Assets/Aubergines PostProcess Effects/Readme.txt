How to use:
Mostly, you have to attach the script to your camera and
If its not already there, pull the necessary shader to the suitable spot on your script.
Forexample; If you add NightVision.cs to your camera, you need to fill the shader spot with NightVision.shader file.

In order to see the effects in editor;
Most of the effects need you to set necessary variables as you please and press start atleast once in order to send your changes to the shader.
You must do this anytime you make changes.

These post processing effects are compatible with Unity Pro version only.
